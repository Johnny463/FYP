 hello all my name is krishna welcome tomy youtube channel so guys today in thisparticular video we are going to discussabout the complete roadmap to preparefor machine learningnow in my previous video i had alreadyuploaded the complete world map for deeplearning the complete roadmap forlearning nlp the complete roadmap forpreparing statisticsand many people had actually requestedme to create the video for the completeroadmap to prepare for machine learningand if you really want to become a datascientist the first thing that you needto be very very good atis machine learning concepts definitelyprogramming is thereso in this video what i'll be doing isthat i'll be showing you the exact paththat you should takeuh if you try to follow this particularpath it will be very very good to youand apart from this i'll also show youfrom where you can actually learn allthese thingsi've created some amazing playlist onmachine learning i've createdso many videos on machine learning alsoso i'll tell you what playlist you haveto followuh and please make sure that you followthose playlists to be very very good atmachine learning itselfso let me just go and show you the pathsothis is an amazing diagram that i haveactually createduh you know based on my experience likehow should what should be the path thatyou should takei've also mentioned about various thingsso let's go from the bottomso in the bottom you'll be able to seethat we have programming languages likepython and rokay so this programming languages arepretty much importantyou can either select python and r butif you really want to goas as a data scientist itself andprobably in the future you are planningto learn deep learning i would suggestgo with python programming languagethen uh we will be doing exploratorydata analysis then we'll probably gowith feature engineeringin exploratory data analysis again guysyou need to really really analyze thedataunderstand about the data and do a wholelot of things with respect to thatthen we are going to the featureengineering section in the futureengineering section you can see in thetopleft corner i've written all the stepsthat we usually do in the futureengineeringwe do things like exploratory dataanalysis we do handling missing valueshandling outlierscategory encoding normalizationstandardization these are some of thestepsthat i have actually mentioned withrespect to feature engineeringthen uh then the next step that we willbe focusing onuh we should focus on is basically thefeature selection in feature selectionagain if you don't remember guys i'vealso started a playlist on featureselectionuh i already have a playlist on featureengineering rightso in the future selection you havemethods like correlation forwardelimination backward eliminationunivariate selections random forestimportance featureselection with uh it should not beelection it should be selection withdecision trees okayso all these techniques you can actuallyapply in thisafter you are good at it and trust meguys this this starting three steps thatis exploratory data analysis featureengineering and feature selection willbe taking30 percent of the overall machinelearning project you know 30 percent ofthe time of the overall machine learningprojectso it is very very important that youtake thisstep very very cautiously learn thesethings in a much more proper wayso that in the companies also wheneveryou are getting the data you will beable to do it much more confidently allthesethree steps then obviously the next stepis basically with respect to machinelearning algorithmsand as you know that whenever we discussabout machine learning algorithms we arebasically going to discuss aboutsupervised and unsupervised machinelearning algorithmsin supervised uh you basically haveregression and classification problemstatementsthen i'd suggest that you go withclustering algorithmsclustering is basically the example ofunsupervised machine learningthere is also a concept of reinforcementlearning but if youare really a starter right now don'tfocus on reinforcement becausereinforcementhas a very big different syllabus pleasedo comment down in the comment box ifyou really want toshow if you really want me to show thepathor the show or the path to actuallyprepare for reinforcement learning thatalso i'll try to do just comment it downin the descriptionin the comment of this particular videonow in machine learning algorithm youhave to initially focus on linear andclassificationregression and classification problemstatements uhinitially you start with linearregression logistic regression decisiontreenow when i talk about linear regressionthose are kind of regression problem inlinearuh whenever you are trying to performsome kind of hyperparameter tuningyou can use lasso and ridge regressionif i talk about classification problemthe first classificationmachine learning algorithm is logisticregression and when i considerother algorithms like decision treerandom forest exhibits which are kind ofassembled techniquesthis has both regression andclassification problem statementsright uh you also have algorithms likename bias again it is used forclassificationyou have support vector machines that isbasicallyas we we have both for regression likesupport vector regression and supportvector classificationi've created videos on all theseparticular algorithms and i'll be goingthrough the playlistonce i complete all this particular pathuh you just have to follow the playlistyou'll be able to learn in a much morebetter waynow when we go through this all thealgorithms the next thing is that movetowards the unsupervised sectorunsupervised sector you can see thatthere are algorithms like claim in suchclustering you have db scan you havehierarchical mean clusteringsright there's also something called asnearest neighbor clusteringthat is also a very good techniqueitself uhbut remember one thing that you shouldalways take care of is thehyperparameter tuning so you will belearning any kind of machine learningalgorithmsyou should always know how to do thehyper parameter tuning intentbecause hyper parameter tuning helps youto uh you know if there is someoverfitting condition that is happeningin your problem statement that will helpyou to remove thatokay now in hyper parameter tuning youhave various techniques like grits or cvrandomizer cv hyperoptuna genetics algorithm in deeplearning also you have something calledas keras tuner and many more thingsnow once you go through all these thingsthis this whole stepsfrom machine learning algorithms to gridsearch right it will be probably taking10 percent of your overallmachine learning project time okay only10 percent guys nothing more than thatbut uh again to create the pipelines andall that will be taking somemore five percent of your overall timeso overalli'll consider 10 to 15 of the overalltime of the machine learning projectokay then comes once you are once yourmodel is ready with some good accuracygood answers then what we do is thatwe will be actually dockerizing it andwith the help of dockerized containerwe'll be doing the deployment in thedeployment we will try to make itscalableby using the techniques of kubernetesokay so that we'll actually doingin the model deployments at the end ofthe day when you completeall these things and guys for all thesethings i have created playlistokay for all these things modeldeployment i have a separate placedocker cubenets i have a separateplaylistyou know hyper parameter tuning featureengineering feature selection i have aseparate playlistall the machine learning algorithms ihave actually created as a separateplaylistyou know so everything i have done onceyou are very good at thistry to just implement end-to-end machinelearning projects as much as you canokay and again for that i have taken onemonth continuously livelive streams in my youtube channel wherei've implemented end-to-end machinelearning projectsonce you know this once you know themodel deployment which all cloud serviceshould actually focus onso here i've actually mentioned googlecloud azure helico and awstry to be at least good at aws azure andgoogle cloud for this also i've madea model deployment playlist guys it'sjust that you have to practicebut always follow this kind of patternsyou can see that this arrow that i'veactually madeokay now in this what are the otherlibraries that are very very muchimportant i'll just move towards thesite so that you will be able to seethisso here you have algo libraries likecbon pandas matplotlib numpy sk learndashpi right so these are some importantlibraries we'll definitely be usingsk learn is one of the most importantlibrary becauseall the all the pre-processingtechniques all the machine learningalgorithmsuh some some of the hyper parametertuning like research randomizerswill be present in sk learn right sothis sql on library is pretty muchimportant i hope everybody is familiarwith thatright now this is the path that youshould follownow this is completely based on myexperience guys and based on this onlyi've uploaded all the videos in myyoutube channelsee if you are trying to enter into datascience industry first of all you needto know the programming knowledge thenyou have to do lot of eda with respectto the data that you havethen you have to go ahead with featureengineering then you have to go withfeature selectionright then you have to go with machinelearning algorithmsin that you try to cover regressionclassification try to understandat least try to understand 80 of thetheoretical understanding of theseparticular algorithmsand probably i think by just followingmy video you'll be able to cover theeighty percentof the uh theoretical understanding ofthoseand then try to implement try to do lotof practical implementationright apart from that you also have toperform hyper parameter tuningright then do the model deployment byseeing my deployment playlist butafter covering all these things you haveto really really solvemany end-to-end projects many end-to-endprojects rightuh two things that i missed over here isabout some of the web frameworks alsoyou should try to learn like flaskdjango streamlet so those kind of videoshas been also uploaded in my videonow one important thing that i missed uhfrom this whole diagramis basically about the nlp so guys nlpwhen i talk about machine learningalgorithms hereyou'll also suppose if your input datais in the form of textso at that time you will also beconsidering doing it with the help ofnatural language processingwhenever i talk about textpre-processing whenever i talk aboutname bias algorithm whenever i talkabout some of the algorithms that aresuitable for this nlp techniques rightfor that i've created a separatepipeline in this pipeline you have textpre-processing techniques in this youwill be doingtokenization limitations top words posin that level 2 you will be doing bag ofwords tfidf unigrams by grams and gramsyou have to learn in this specificpatternand then you also have some advancedtext preprocessing like gen sim word towork average word to workand then you really have to solve manymachine learning use cases and finallydo the model deploymentthe two libraries whenever you arepreparing machine learning with nlp thatyou should focus on is nltk and spaceyif you are good at these two librariesprobably with respect to machinelearning any question that comes up withnlpyou will be able to answer with allthese things again model deployment isthe same deployment techniques that wewill be using over herewith the help of flask or streamlet youknow or djangodefinitely one model will be there inthe back end from which will create afront end from which will give the inputlike sentiment analysis and allit will interact with the model and itwill give you the output okayso this was two amazing uh thing thati've actually created i reallyput a lot of effort in creating thisparticular diagram because i wanted toinclude everythingwhat you have to do is that just keepthe screenshot with you soand probably stick it if you'repreparing for data then stick it in yourboardor stick it in your wall and try toeveryday see to it right whether you'reable to cover everything or noti could not write all the machinelearning algorithms over here but someof the machine learning algorithms ihave already told youright uh on top of it you can add morethings as you want okayand again y'all everybody's learningpattern is completely different guys ihave given you theblueprint of this particular learningmap okay now let's go ahead and try toseefrom where all from which youtubeplaylist you can actually watch thisparticular videos and just follow thoseplaylists guys it will be more thansufficientso let's go ahead so guys the firstplaylist that you actually follow youhave to followis the complete machine learningplaylist in this playlist uh as per thediagram that i've actually shown yourightwhere we started with the programminglanguage then we wentwith different different techniques wewent with statistical conceptsone important thing that i forgot tomention over there guys you need to alsoknowhave knowledge with respect tostatistics that is also pretty muchimportantwith respect to machine learning thatplaylist also i've actually createdso here you actually have completemachine learning playlist here you willbe basically starting with pythonprogramminglanguage videos so here you can seepython programming then you will be ableto see some practical applications withrespect to statisticsand here is where we are actuallystarting with the machine learningalgorithms like linear regression bridgeand lasso regressionwith practical implementation multiplelinear regression with python and scaleonthen you can see linear regression biasand variance what is overfitting underfittinguh performance matrix in linearregression so here you'll be able to seethat i've covered every algorithms thati had mentioned over therelogistic regression decision trees youknow uhadvanced size prediction performancemetrics k nearest neighbors this isbasically theuh k nearest neighbor is again asupervised machine learning technique itcan be used for both classification andregression problem statementthen you have random forest then youhave handling missing data you havesomething called as hyper parameteroptimization for exe boost then you haveada boostyou have euclidean distance managementdistance you have unsupervised machinelearning techniques so all these videoshas been uploaded over heretheoretical understanding is also beendone like for nay biasthe whole theory has been written in theboard you'll be able to understand itfrom thereyou have support vector machines againmaths intuition deriveddefined properly along with practicalimplementation you have a lot ofapplications also that i have actuallycreatedyou can also perform eda of differentdifferent techniques of eda are actuallymentioned again uh recently i've done awhole lot of exploration with differentdifferenteda techniques end-to-end implementationalso has been includedthis was one of the playlist that ismuch complete machine learning playlistagain there are so many videos on thisuh the next thing that you also have tofocus on is basically my featureengineering playlistso in this feature engineering playlisti have uploaded all the differenttechniquesof feature engineering this will bepretty much handy for youbecause this is the second step that wereally want to focus on rightand if you if you remember the diagramthat i showed you just a while back overthereall the techniques of featureengineering has been includeduh should be is included in thisspecific playlist itself okayso this was the next playlist here youalso have somewhere aroundyou know i guess 14 to 15 videos sowhich will be pretty much handyi've also started a feature selectionplaylist so yes this is the featureselection playlist that i have actuallycreated right now i've just uploaded twovideos some random videos i haveuploaded with respect to featureselectionwith some of the techniques you can alsogo through this apart from that guysyou'll also be seeing that i havecreated somesql database playlist with python andmongodb playlist with python also sothis link will also be given in thedescription of this particular videosome important thing is with respect todockers end to endhere we have created some machinelearning application themachine learning application name isbanknote authentication so you can alsofollow this docker playlist which willbe pretty much importantnow many people are also very muchinterested with respect to kaggleplaylistlike how do we solve kaggle problems sofor that also i've created thisparticular playlist for kaggle wherei've actually implemented a lot ofend-to-end solutionsright with respect to natural languageprocessing now when we are going intonatural language it is better that youfirst of all complete this naturallanguage playlist so here you can seethe complete roadmap to prepare fornatural language processing will also bei've given over here but with respect tomachine learning i think you shoulduh you should try to do till thisparticular tutorialthat is your i think this tutorial issomewhere around 11th or 12th tutorialso you should try to do it till herethat is kyle competition which will beincluded in the machine learningtechniquesso if you are just only planning forpreparing for machine learning i thinkall these tutorials you can follow tillkaggle competition where you'reprotecting the stockprice movement based on news headlinesusing nlp so here i've alsoincluded all the different differentthings that you can actually doone thing that you need to remember guysthis all techniques has been technics ofnlp has been done with the help ofuh sklm that is the sky kit learn okayuhnot skype sorry nltk nltk library youcan also do you can also usea spacey library and you can do the samethings with the help of spacey librarytoobut with respect to all the machinelearning algorithms that we havediscussed in another playlistlike in this complete machine learningplaylist we have definitely usedsky kit learn a lot okay then uhobviously you need to prepare for thedata science interview questions so herei have actually created a lot ofinterview questions and probably i'll beupdating this playlistas we go ahead so this will be prettymuch important for you this all playlistyou can actually check it outwith respect to data science interviewquestions which will be pretty muchhandyagain more than 50 videos are there itwill be very very helpful for you allagain don't worry all these links willbe given the reason why i'm telling youyou have to just follow that specificpath one by oneand you have to basically complete themachine learning as soon as possibleand since i have provided you all theplaylist guys if you follow i thinkhardly within 45 daysalong with the practice you'll be ableto complete everything okayuh apart from that apart from the datascience interviews i've also takenlive virtual interviews okay so livevirtual interviews you can see over hereso many live virtual interviews has beentaken hereboth machine learning and deep learningquestions has been asked but in some ofthe interviews wheremany people like machine learning youknow i have asked a lot of questionswith respect to thatover there itself okay so please makesure that you follow these live virtualinterviews that will give you aconfidence like how you should answerthe questions and allfinally for the members i have alsocreated a lot ofdata science projects machine learningprojects so here you can see there aremore than 72 videos in this projectsand yes i'll be uploading more uhmembershipfor membership projects probably todayi'm also planning to upload oneseparate project for membership soplease make sure that you join themembership try to support meand again the amount the money is veryvery small uh basically for the freshersuhfor the people who are not having jobsit is 59 rupees for professional it is2.99you can use google pay also you can usesome kind of credit card or debit cardthat will be actually helpful for meif you join the membership uh it'll giveme some monetary benefitsso finally guys what i would like tosuggest you is that when i am givingthis playlist linkit will be given in the same order youjust have to go and prepare for itand you have to make sure that since ihave given you all the playlist in anorderyou can definitely complete it in 45days so finallyjust try to follow this whole thing thati've actually mentionedit will definitely be very very usefulfor you it will definitely be very veryhelpful for youthe the same thing has been followed bymany of my subscribers they have gotable to get many jobs as suchin the data science industry itself thisthing will also happen with youif you are pretty much studious if youare pretty much following all the thingsthat i'm actually mentioning youso i hope you like this particular videoplease do subscribe the channel if youhave not already subscribe i'll see youin the next video have a great daythank you and all bye
