Hello, My name is Krishna and welcome to my Youtube channel today. In this particular video, we'll be discussing about a very important library which is called a Spy Forest now by Forest. Just pretty much useful library guys because recently I've used this and I found out a lot of uses of this. So in short it imports most of the python data science libraries just by installing this pie forest libraries in your environment. So it imports all the popular python leaders and libraries so that they are always there when you need them. If you don't use the library won't be important. So first of all, I'll just go and you know, open and conduct and show you how you can install this particular library. So just you need to right click install and you have to write as by Forest. So once you do this, it will get automatically installed. It takes somewhere around 30 seconds for you to install and once it is installed now currently have installed in my laptop so you can see that requirements already satisfied. And this is the location when it has got installed. Now, what I'll do is that I will quickly go and copy and paste one you are from where we'll be reading some CSB five with the help of Reid and Associates. Now, you know that Reid and Associates is an inbuilt function of pandas right over here. I've just used Elias name, like I can also use pd one if I want. Elias is not a concern over here. The main thing is about the inbuilt function as soon as I execute this, I'm not I mean imported any pandas library but here you can see that it has got executed successfully and this is all because of this pie forest library. If I go and I d f dot and if I see this, you will be able to see the data now. How do we understand that? How many libraries has got important? And as I told that whenever we require it, it will get important only. And just by code that you are writing any function that you're using, it will import that specific library. So if I execute one command called us active imports now you can see over here, partner has got imported very easily right, even though I'm not imported in the initial status. Similarly, what I can do is that I can also use macros and we can also use Numpy So let me just create some list like LSD 12 and I'll try to plot this with the help of, you know, Mark. So in order to use it properly but use plt dot plot. And again, guys, this alliance can be anything okay? You do not have concerned with respect to the allies. The main thing is that it will just go and see whether they will function is getting mapped to that particular library or not. So here I'm going to plot list one and list too and I'm going to say Plt dot x label, I'm going to say X axis and then I'm going to say plt dot y label. And then I'm also going to say why access after that. I'm going to say you don't show here, you can see that once, once I execute this particular line of code automatically, the matte lip, like I mean the visualization graph is getting created away here. And if I again right, active underscore imports now, you'll be able to see two libraries right? Because I've used this also. So now you have pandas and Mark. That has got important. Similarly, you can also use arrays, numpy arrays so I can write np dot array. And here you can basically give a list of values like 12345 and here automatically are able to get created. Now if I try to again use active inputs, you can see that number has also got imported similarly, you can also go ahead with Seaborn suppose I'll create a data strip which is like period or read. And the CS. And here I have a dataset called us most of these banks. Okay, so once I executed now Seaborn has one inbuilt function called a disc plot. And if I give D F F, let me just show you what all variables are here. So if I write DF one dot head, you can see that I have various data like this kind of columns that are present and have taken this dataset from google, you can also try with any data set. What I do is that I write DF one of why and I'll try to create a display so once I execute this you will be able to see a wonderful graph. Right? So this is your instagram on this plot, basically the probability density function. And if you again right active imports, you'll be able to see the library has got imported. So you can see see bone is also getting important and it is mapped to the last So pretty much amazing library which has recently used and as you know that whatever I get to know, I'll definitely be sharing with you describe in your use cases, try to use this and again, this is the least important technique only when you're using the read function only that time only the library will get automatically stuff. So I hope you like this particular video please to subscribe the channel. If you're not already subscribed, please share with all your friends. Whoever require this kind of help, I'll see you on the next video. Have a great day. Thank you
